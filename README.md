# Artificial-Neural-Network-for-triaxial-test-for-cemented-and-biocemented-soil
This work is based on Geotechnical issues for triaxial tests. 
It was developed to perform the prediction of geotechnical parameters for drained triaxial tests in specific situations: cemented and biocemented soils.
As inputs: cement, fiver, W, gamaD, initial void ratio, volume of biocement solution, confinant pression, counterpressure.
As outputs: Final axial deformation, volumetric deformation, p, q and final void ratio. 

This work is not published yet. it has been under development.
The database was colected in dissertations and thesis from 2 Universisties in Brazil: UPF and UFRGS.
